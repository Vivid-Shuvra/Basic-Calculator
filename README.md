# Basic-Calculator
# Emoji Based Calculator

This repository shows the coding snippet for developing an appliation to support the following calculations:
ðŸ‘½ Addition (Alien U+1F47D)
ðŸ’€ Subtraction (Skull U+1F480)
ðŸ‘» Multiplication (Ghost U+1F47B)
ðŸ˜± Division (Scream U+1F631)

# Approaches:
When we enter the application, we get to see
- a UI consisting a basic form with two textfields demanding two operands (numbers)
- a dropdown list having the operators
- a submit button
- a heading paragraph and a text area showing the response 

=> bootstrap used in the frontend and php used in the server side

=> xampp used for connecting localhost and the backend server

# Steps:
- Firstly, Apache needs to be run on the Xampp control panel
- After connecting the localhost, user have to make entry the operands with an associated operation
- Finally, the result will be shown in a text area
